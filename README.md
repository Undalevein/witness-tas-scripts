# Witness TAS Scripts

These are a collection of TAS speedrun scripts written for RainbowwPhoenix's TAS program, [witas](https://github.com/RainbowwPhoenixx/witas). Scripts with the `.wtas` extension are witas files, which is fed into the TAS to perform game inputs at incredible precision.

## File Descriptions

### TAS Scripts

Below are the TAS scripts I have written. Each should have a description at the top of what in-game settings your game should be, including resolution, field of view or FOV, frames per second or FPS, and geometry graphics if so. They should be readjusted to match the descriptions of said settings. For readjusting FOV specifically, it is recommended to readjust the through [darkid's Witness Speedrunning Trainer Mod](https://github.com/jbzdarkid/witness-trainer) for getting the precise number.

|      File Name      |                  Description                      |     File Requisites     |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|
| **all_lasers.wtas** | TAS for the All Lasers base speedrun category.    |                         |
|    desert_AL.wtas   | TAS that follows All Lasers, beginning in Desert. | desert.witness_campaign |

### Saves

Witas does not have any save states, so for files in the `saves` folder, I saved some save files `.witness_campaign`
